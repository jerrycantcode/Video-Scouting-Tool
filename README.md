## Some Context

I was doing some pre-scouting for my FIRST robotics team using The Blue Alliance and I was upset how long it took to access all the videos for the matches.

When I was thinking about this, I realized I had a project on the backburner for a while that did similar things using TBA's API v3. I remembered you can use the API to access pretty much all the data that The Blue Alliance's website shows you. This included the videos of matches that happened in the past. I knew I had to use this to make a tool that would make pre-scouting a lot easier, and that pretty much brings me here.

With some very Basic Javascript, HTML, and minimal CSS, I created this thing that makes accessing these videos a much more streamline process. I hope you enjoy using it.

## How to use

To use this program, all you have to do is download it and open it in any web browser. Input the team number you want to scout, select the event you're scouting, then select the match you want to scout. If there's a video, it should display on your screen

## Please Note

I know that this isn't optimized whatsoever, and it probably wouldn't work on many screen types like phones. I literally started this a few minutes ago, and I hope to update it in the future to make it more user friendly. If any errors occur, I'm sorry. Please bear with me.
