## Some Context

I was doing some pre-scouting for my FIRST robotics team using The Blue Alliance and I was upset how long it took to access all the videos for the matches.

When I was thinking about this, I realized I had a project on the backburner for a while that did similar things using TBA's API v3. I remembered you can use the API to access pretty much all the data that The Blue Alliance's website shows you. This included the videos of matches that happened in the past. I knew I had to use this to make a tool that would make pre-scouting a lot easier, and that pretty much brings me here.

With some very Basic Javascript, HTML, and minimal CSS, I created this thing that makes accessing these videos a much more streamline process. I hope you enjoy using it.

##Uses

Used mostly for pre-event-scouting or match review

## How to use

To use this program, all you have to do is download it and open it in any web browser. Input the team number you want to scout, select the event you're scouting, then select the match you want to scout. If there's a video, it should display on your screen

##updates

v1.0 - the most bare-bones version of the tool, no UI, poor styling, no mobile device support

v2.0 - after a few hours, I designed the UI for this and It works on all devices and makes the process much easier
